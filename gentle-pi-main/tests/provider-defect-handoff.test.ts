// Pins the port of Gentle AI's v2.4.0-rc.8 provider-defect handoff consent
// contract (the gentle-ai.review-integration.consent/v3 envelope; canonical
// source internal/assets/generic/sdd-orchestrator.md at tag v2.4.0-rc.8 of
// Gentleman-Programming/gentle-ai) into Pi's lazy-loaded orchestrator assets.

// structural presence, ordering, and the removal of stale rc.3-era rules; they
