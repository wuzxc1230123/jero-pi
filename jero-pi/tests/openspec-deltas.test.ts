## Purpose

Example domain.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Existing Behavior

The system MUST keep existing behavior.

#### Scenario: Happy path

- GIVEN an existing condition
- WHEN the action runs
- THEN existing behavior is preserved

---

### Requirement: Deprecated Behavior

The system MUST support old behavior.

#### Scenario: Old path

- GIVEN an old condition
- WHEN the action runs
- THEN old behavior is preserved
`;

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: New Behavior

The system MUST support new behavior.

#### Scenario: New path

- GIVEN a new condition
- WHEN the action runs
- THEN new behavior is available

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Existing Behavior

The system MUST keep existing behavior and report audit evidence.
(Previously: existing behavior did not report audit evidence)

#### Scenario: Happy path

- GIVEN an existing condition
- WHEN the action runs
- THEN existing behavior is preserved
- AND audit evidence is recorded

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Deprecated Behavior

(Reason: old behavior is no longer supported)
