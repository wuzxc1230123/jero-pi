// gentle-ai's negotiated `start/v2` envelope is a closed schema, so it cannot
// carry the `risk_evidence` phrases its plain sibling emits. Pi renders them
// from `risk_reasons`, which start/v2 does carry, and that makes Pi a second
// surface for a vocabulary whose Go home (internal/cli/review_mode.go) is
// documented as the single phrasing source precisely so surfaces cannot drift.
//
// These cases are field truth, not hand-written expectations: each pair was
// captured from the real gentle-ai v2.2.0 binary run twice over one candidate,
// once plain for `risk_evidence` and once negotiated for `risk_reasons`. If a
// future gentle-ai changes a phrase, this fails instead of Pi quietly showing
// an operator a sentence the CLI stopped saying.
