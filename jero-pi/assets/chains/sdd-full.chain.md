description: Run the full SDD lifecycle for a change in auto mode or explicit full-lifecycle approval.

## Parent preflight transport guard

Run only after the interactive parent has resolved SDD preflight and injected its exact rendered `## SDD Session Preflight` block into every child context. A chain and its RPC children must consume that transport, never infer, confirm, originate, or persist defaults. Missing or malformed transport blocks the chain before its first phase.

## Interactive mode guard

This chain is a continuous lifecycle pipeline. Use it only in auto mode or explicit full-lifecycle approval. In interactive mode the parent/orchestrator must stop at each phase boundary, present the current artifact, and ask the user before continuing. Approval to start SDD is not approval of the generated proposal, specs, design, tasks, apply, verify, sync, or archive phases.

## sdd-init

output: init.md
outputMode: file-only
progress: true

Initialize SDD context for {task} before any planning or implementation. If the artifact store is `openspec` or `both` and `openspec/config.yaml` is missing, inspect the project and create it automatically. If the artifact store is `engram` or `none`, skip OpenSpec file creation. If `openspec/config.yaml` already exists, read it, refresh only safe derived context when appropriate, and report the current SDD/testing configuration without blocking the chain.

## sdd-explore

reads: init.md
output: exploration.md
outputMode: file-only
progress: true

Explore {task}. Identify scope, risks, dependencies, prior art, and whether the change should proceed into proposal.

## sdd-proposal

reads: exploration.md
output: proposal.md
outputMode: file-only
progress: true

Create or update the OpenSpec proposal for {task} using the exploration notes and the previous step output. If this is an interactive SDD run and the parent has not already supplied proposal-shaping answers, surface the missing questions in the result so the parent can ask before treating the proposal as approved.

## sdd-spec

reads: proposal.md
output: spec.md
outputMode: file-only
progress: true

Write delta specs for {task} from the parent-approved proposal. Preserve RFC 2119 requirements and Given/When/Then scenarios. In interactive mode, do not treat chain execution alone as proposal approval.

## sdd-design

reads: proposal.md+spec.md
output: design.md
outputMode: file-only
progress: true

Design the technical approach for {task} using the proposal, specs, and previous outputs. Call out review and judgment risks.

## sdd-tasks

reads: proposal.md+spec.md+design.md
output: tasks.md
outputMode: file-only
progress: true

Create strict-TDD, reviewable implementation tasks for {task}. Include the required Review Workload Forecast guard lines and PR split recommendation.

## sdd-apply

reads: proposal.md+spec.md+design.md+tasks.md
output: apply-progress.md
outputMode: file-only
progress: true

Implement only approved implementation-owned tasks for {task}; enforce strict TDD when active and stop before writing if workload decisions are unresolved. Update OpenSpec tasks and apply-progress with evidence. When implementation completes, continue directly to independent verification. The SDD route is apply -> verify -> sync -> archive; no RDD authority, receipt, or delivery gate is required between phases.

## sdd-verify

reads: proposal.md+spec.md+design.md+tasks.md+apply-progress.md
output: verify-report.md
outputMode: file-only
progress: true

Verify {task} against specs, design, tasks, implementation, apply-progress, strict TDD evidence, assertion quality, and review workload boundaries.

## sdd-sync

reads: proposal.md+spec.md+design.md+tasks.md+apply-progress.md+verify-report.md
output: sync-report.md
outputMode: file-only
progress: true

Sync verified file-backed delta specs for {task} into `openspec/specs/` without archiving. In Engram-only mode, report that canonical sync is not applicable.

## sdd-archive

reads: verify-report.md+sync-report.md
output: archive-report.md
outputMode: file-only
progress: true

Archive {task} only when the verification report passes and file-backed sync is complete or not applicable; otherwise report that archive is blocked and preserve active artifacts.
