# Final Verification Report: Consolidate Review Parity Runtime

## Verdict

**PASS — 12/12 requirements, 27/27 scenarios, 17/17 implementation tasks, strict TDD checks, and every required command pass.**

The approved post-correction lineage is content-bound to index tree `1ea94a5b512a447871769e265924fbfd8f1e789c`. The final correction closes bounded transient HTTP retry, candidate-view Git timeout, and resumed/reuse lens-metadata findings. Full `pnpm test` reports the expected **729 passing tests**, followed by the runtime harness.

No implementation, test, package, authority, index, lifecycle, delivery, commit, push, PR, merge, release, or archive mutation was performed. This report is the only edited path.

## Evidence revision

`evidence_revision` is SHA-256 over 1,302 exact UTF-8 bytes of canonical JSON (`gentle-ai.verify-evidence/v1`) containing the verdict, approved authority/binding/tree, 12/12 requirement and 27/27 scenario coverage, 17/17 task completion, command output hashes, v2.1.4 runtime provenance, strict-TDD result, and empty blocker/critical arrays.

## Structured status and action context

The authoritative pre-persistence status was obtained with:

```sh
gentle-ai sdd-status consolidate-review-parity-runtime --cwd /home/gentleman/work/gentle-pi --json --instructions
```

| Field | Verified value |
|---|---|
| Change | `consolidate-review-parity-runtime` |
| Artifact store | `openspec` (authoritative) |
| Proposal/specs/design/tasks/apply-progress | `done` |
| Apply state | `all_done` |
| Task progress | 17 complete, 0 pending |
| Review gate | `allow` — explicit bound compact authority exactly matched the repository |
| Action context mode | `repo-local` |
| Workspace root | `/home/gentleman/work/gentle-pi` |
| Allowed edit root | `/home/gentleman/work/gentle-pi` |
| Blocked reasons | none |

The active change is explicit and unambiguous. All implementation and report paths are inside the authoritative workspace and allowed edit root. CodeGraph ordering was respected: the existing `.codegraph/` index was checked first; MCP returned `MCP not initialized`, then local `codegraph explore -p /home/gentleman/work/gentle-pi ...` succeeded before targeted source reads.

## Approved content-bound authority

| Field | Verified value |
|---|---|
| Lineage | `review-fc8372e5c81b2074` |
| State | `approved` |
| Authority revision | `sha256:6689109d1a1092ae079eba2c48616c0b9074d005e81ce1240da6bdd0229d5274` |
| Receipt hash | `sha256:039f2029cf408e4b93d0c952475b7e6ababbb2d2b7279287122346c1604e5a15` |
| SDD binding revision | `sha256:13abb2a1b7524b54ed116de9bdf2c47c47254d02cd7ab85f68ddf1ac5f995057` |
| Final candidate/index tree | `1ea94a5b512a447871769e265924fbfd8f1e789c` |
| Risk / lenses | high / exact 4R set |
| Resolved corrections | `RELIABILITY-001`, `RESILIENCE-001`, `RESILIENCE-002` |
| Correction scope | 6 files, 137/200 lines |

`review-state.json`, `review-receipt.json`, the SDD binding, and `git write-tree` agree on lineage, authority revision, terminal approval, binding revision, and final candidate tree. The native SDD status independently reported an allowing review gate before report persistence.

## Task completion and review workload

- Exact unchecked implementation task lines: **none**.
- Task markers: **17 checked, 0 unchecked**; no malformed ownership markers.
- Forecast: chained PRs **No**; `exception-ok` / `size-exception` explicitly recorded.
- The approved authority retained one high-risk 4R boundary and one 137-line correction within the frozen 200-line budget.
- The correction touched only `lib/native-review-cli.ts`, `lib/review-candidate-view.ts`, `scripts/gentle-ai-installer.mjs`, `tests/gentle-ai-installer.test.ts`, `tests/native-review-cli.test.ts`, and `tests/review-candidate-view.test.ts`, matching the frozen correction scope.
- No chained slice, extra PR boundary, lifecycle action, or delivery scope was introduced.

## Final correction verification

### Transient HTTP retry

| Check | Evidence | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Bounded attempts | default `attempts: 2`; focused tests observe exactly two attempts | PASS |
| Transient HTTP classification | retries only `429`, `500`, `502`, `503`, `504` | PASS |
| Permanent HTTP classification | `400` and `404` stop after one attempt | PASS |
| Network/timeouts | bounded retry codes include timeout and transient network failures | PASS |
| Cleanup between attempts | destination is removed before the retry | PASS |
| Integrity/extraction/promotion | remain outside the retry loop and fail closed | PASS |

The focused test `download retries only transient HTTP statuses and exhausts within the attempt bound` exercises every listed HTTP status and asserts exact attempt counts. Header/body timeout exhaustion is independently covered.

### Bounded candidate Git timeout

All candidate-view Git execution routes through `candidateGit`, which supplies `timeout: 10_000`, captured stderr, hidden Windows process windows, and fail-closed timeout mapping. The regression injects an `ETIMEDOUT`/killed executor, confirms the exact timeout, and proves materialization stops before any `git worktree` execution.

### Resumed/reuse lens metadata

The v2.1.4 decoder separates authoritative `selected_lenses` metadata from actor-dispatch instruction `lenses_required`:

- medium/high `resumed` responses may retain canonical selected lenses with `lenses_required: false`;
- high-risk `reuse-receipt` may retain the full canonical 4R set with `lenses_required: false`;
- false-lens routes dispatch no actors while preserving metadata;
- contradictory created/resumed/reuse/scope-block combinations, duplicate lenses, noncanonical risk-tier sets, and resumed terminal states with `lenses_required: true` fail schema-closed.

Focused native-adapter and controller matrices pass, including exact ambiguous START replay without a duplicate budget.

## Official Gentle AI v2.1.4 provenance

| Evidence | Verified value | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Release URL/tag | `.../releases/download/v2.1.4/` | PASS |
| Six platform asset mappings | exact v2.1.4 names and pinned SHA-256 values | PASS |
| Linux/amd64 archive | `gentle-ai_2.1.4_linux_amd64.tar.gz` | PASS |
| Linux/amd64 archive SHA-256 | `6f12f906b6aca5b45e4177b1ff0ae4e3792516877861bfb37a654d76f77e72c2` | PASS |
| Manifest version/asset/archive hash | exact match | PASS |
| Manifest binary SHA-256 | `aa60f95186520d6e8c70bb9cca8d8a5735adbc3b69576519d35e32754aed261a` | PASS |
| Package-local binary SHA-256 | `aa60f95186520d6e8c70bb9cca8d8a5735adbc3b69576519d35e32754aed261a` | PASS |
| Runtime version | `gentle-ai 2.1.4` | PASS |
| Real native parity | unchanged tracked + initially-untracked candidate allows; changed staging denies | PASS |

Production resolver, installer, explicit installer, native adapter, package verifier, parity fixture, manifest, and binary agree on v2.1.4. Runtime resolution remains absolute and package-local with no PATH/global or v2.1.3 fallback.

## Specification coverage

| Specification | Requirement coverage | Scenario coverage | Result |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Package runtime | 3/3 | 9/9 | PASS |
| Review runtime | 9/9 | 18/18 | PASS |
| **Total** | **12/12** | **27/27** | **PASS** |

### Requirement evidence

| Requirement | Verification evidence | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Package-local provisioning | exact v2.1.4 pin, six digests, absolute resolver, manifest/binary hash, no fallback, installer/binary/package tests | PASS |
| Windows persistence ownership | upstream tracker #1249 preserved; no Pi shadow authority implementation introduced | PASS |
| Package release evidence | focused/full/parity/harness/verifier/diff/provenance commands pass | PASS |
| Immutable reviewer snapshot | candidate-view integrity, divergence, unsafe/stale/corrupt/oversized pre-dispatch denial tests | PASS |
| START/FINALIZE/pre-commit projection parity | official native parity allows unchanged staged tracked/untracked content and denies drift | PASS |
| Honest mismatch diagnostics | released context only; tracker #1248 preserved where expected/path-diff data is absent | PASS |
| Discoverable FINALIZE input | facade/controller contract tests cover nested lens results and paired final evidence | PASS |
| Native policy identity | native policy path/internal identity retained; no Pi-defined canonical native hash | PASS |
| Exact fork head | owner-qualified remote/advertised-head allow and malformed/ambiguous/divergent denial tests | PASS |
| Candidate-filtered lifecycle discovery | unrelated history excluded; matching/ambiguous/invalid authority remains closed | PASS |
| Truthful issue dispositions | #96/#113/#119/#122/#123/#124/#128/#129/#133/#137 each retain one evidence-linked disposition | PASS |
| Fail-closed lifecycle gates | no actor output or wrapper authorizes delivery; native gate and bash-time rederivation tests pass | PASS |

All acceptance scenarios have positive/negative evidence at the applicable unit/contract or integration/runtime layer. Upstream-blocked items remain linked to #1247, #1248, and #1249 rather than being claimed as locally delivered.

## Strict TDD compliance

`openspec/config.yaml` enables strict TDD and configures `pnpm test`. `apply-progress.md` contains cumulative `TDD Cycle Evidence` tables, including the final v2.1.4 migration. The approved correction record supplies the exact post-apply finding IDs, six-file correction snapshot, original-criteria pass, correction-regression pass, and approved final evidence. Every reported test path exists and current GREEN was independently rerun.

| Check | Result | Details |
|---|---|---|
| TDD evidence table present | PASS | cumulative RED/GREEN/TRIANGULATE/REFACTOR evidence exists |
| RED cross-reference | PASS | migration RED and three bounded correction findings are recorded |
| Test files exist | PASS | all changed/created test and harness paths resolve |
| GREEN current | PASS | focused 156/156; full 729/729; parity/harness/verifier pass |
| Triangulation | PASS | positive/negative retry, timeout, risk/lens, projection, integrity, and drift vectors |
| Safety net | PASS | cumulative focused/full baselines plus independent full rerun |
| Correction regression | PASS | approved authority records original criteria and correction regression as passed |

**TDD compliance: PASS.**

### Test layer distribution

| Layer | Test declarations/checks | Files | Tools |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Unit/contract | 105 | 6 | `node:test` |
| Integration/runtime | 117 | 5 including harness | `node:test` + custom runtime harness |
| E2E | 0 | 0 | not configured |
| **Changed/related total** | **222** | **11** | |

The repository-level command independently reports 729 passing `node:test` tests and then runs the runtime harness.

### Assertion quality

All 11 changed/created test or harness files were scanned for tautologies, ghost loops, assertions without production calls, type-only-only assertions, smoke-only tests, implementation-detail CSS assertions, orphan empty checks, and mock-heavy patterns.

- No tautologies, ghost loops, smoke-only UI assertions, CSS assertions, or mock-heavy tests were found.
- Matrix loops use statically non-empty vectors and invoke production code on every iteration.
- Type/shape assertions are paired with value, state-transition, command-blocking, or other behavioral assertions.
- Empty-result assertions verify cleanup or fail-closed outcomes after production execution.

**Assertion quality: PASS — 0 CRITICAL, 0 WARNING.**

### Coverage and quality metrics

- Coverage analysis skipped — no coverage command is configured.
- Linter: not available.
- Type checker: not available.

These are informational and non-blocking under `openspec/config.yaml`.

## Findings

### CRITICAL

None.

### WARNING

1. `design.md` still narrates the superseded v2.1.3 migration. The version-agnostic specifications, final apply evidence, implementation, runtime, and approved v2.1.4 binding are coherent, so this is archive-time provenance debt rather than a runtime/spec failure.
2. `state.yaml` and the final apply synchronization retain the earlier `review-ca0c5ee1e22c737c` migration binding, while the authoritative post-correction binding is `review-fc8372e5c81b2074`. Native status and the current binding are authoritative; reconcile historical OpenSpec metadata without rewriting review authority.
3. The approved review retains non-blocking informational findings, including an extraction-process deadline suggestion and readability cleanup. None is classified as a severe unresolved blocker.

### SUGGESTION

Rename the historical `NativeReviewCliV213` compatibility alias in a later bounded cleanup. Production instantiation is v2.1.4 and exact runtime verification rejects incompatible versions.

## Exact blockers

- Verification blockers: **none**.
- CRITICAL findings: **none**.
- Unchecked implementation tasks: **none**.
- Archive/lifecycle boundary after persistence: this report changes the report-bearing worktree relative to the reviewed index tree. The parent must refresh/validate content-bound authority before archive or delivery; this verification performs no lifecycle action.

## Next action

Parent-owned content-bound lifecycle reconciliation, then archive only if authoritative native status allows it. Verification itself is complete and passing.

> **Archive-time disposition note (2026-08-01, added by `sdd-archive`).** The parent-owned lifecycle reconciliation referenced above could not complete through the native archive gate: it is blocked by a confirmed provider defect, reported as `Gentleman-Programming/gentle-ai#2128`. Receipt-driven development remains disabled by the maintainer's standing global decision (`gentle-ai review mode status` → `off (decided by global)`), which this change did not alter and did not need to alter, since policy permits archiving when the kill switch is off and delivery reports `disabled/unmanaged`. WARNING findings 1 and 2 above were resolved as archive-time provenance work in `design.md` and `state.yaml`; see `ARCHIVE-REPORT.md` for the full account. No CRITICAL finding existed at any point, and this verification's PASS verdict is unchanged by the manual archive path.
