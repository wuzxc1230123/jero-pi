# Tasks: Worktree-Aware Review Authority

## Review Workload Forecast

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Estimated changed lines | 900–1,300 (runtime, tests, SDD assets, support contract, and status-chain integration) |
| 400-line budget risk | High |
| Chained PRs recommended | No |
| Suggested split | Single PR |
| Delivery strategy | single-pr |
| Chain strategy | size-exception |

Decision needed before apply: No
Chained PRs recommended: No
Chain strategy: size-exception
400-line budget risk: High

The expanded same-PR scope is explicitly approved. No artificial line cap or new split decision applies; keep implementation and tests cohesive and use work-unit boundaries for reviewability.

## Execution Contract

- Strict TDD is active: RED → GREEN → TRIANGULATE → REFACTOR, with `pnpm test` as the full runner.
- Every checkbox below is implementation-owned and carries exactly one canonical ownership marker.
- Legacy compatibility is runtime behavior, not authoring style: all new task rows use the marker syntax.
- Keep tests with the behavior they verify and preserve schemas, receipts, common-directory layout, worktree identity rules, and graph-v1/legacy semantics.
- `sdd-apply` executes only implementation-owned rows and stops on malformed ownership markers.

## 1. Complete live candidate and reset recovery seams

**Files:** `lib/review-snapshot.ts`, `extensions/gentle-ai.ts`, `tests/review-snapshot.test.ts`, `tests/review-controller.test.ts`.

- [x] **RED:** Add ephemeral-binding coverage for repository ID, base tree, complete/current candidate trees, canonical changed paths, and intended-untracked scope, including preservation of the real index and zero retained snapshot/authority mutation. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->
- [x] **GREEN:** Add `LiveReviewCandidateBinding` and missing-reset-state typed mapping without changing `SnapshotV1` or mutating authority before the error is returned. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->
- [x] **RED:** Add RECOVER regression coverage for absent exact `control/reset-state.json`, identical retry output, unchanged authority inventory, and zero writes. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->
- [x] **TRIANGULATE:** Verify malformed, integrity, repository-mismatch, authorization, and unsafe-path errors remain distinct; run focused snapshot/controller tests. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->
- [x] **REFACTOR:** Preserve temporary-index/object cleanup and use const-object-derived controller outcome types. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->

## 2. Bind terminal discovery to authority and prove every dimension

**Files:** `lib/review-compact-store.ts`, `lib/review-facade.ts`, `tests/review-facade.test.ts`.

- [x] **GREEN:** Compare validated terminal receipts against base tree, final candidate tree, canonical changed-path hash, intended-untracked hash, and policy hash. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->
- [x] **RED:** Add independent regression cases where each of repository authority, `base_tree`, `final_candidate_tree`, changed-path hash, intended-untracked hash, and policy differs from terminal A and prevents reuse. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->
- [x] **RED:** Add provenance regressions for detached receipts, transplanted stores/pinned identity mismatch, authority tuple mismatch/race, and invalid terminal data not being treated as “no match.” <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->
- [x] **GREEN:** Pass one validated `RepositoryAuthorityV1` through read-only discovery and expose an internal `TerminalReviewCandidateBinding` without schema or path-identity changes. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->
- [x] **TRIANGULATE:** Assert terminal receipt/state bytes, store paths, and pre-existing receipt hash remain unchanged after applicability inspection or another candidate START. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->
- [x] **REFACTOR:** Centralize comparison/hash projection and retain typed fail-closed authority/integrity errors. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->

## 3. Make START deterministic and idempotent

**Files:** `lib/review-facade.ts`, `tests/review-facade.test.ts`.

- [x] **GREEN:** Include policy in derived lineage identity and collect validated exact matches deterministically rather than selecting the first match. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->
- [x] **GREEN:** Add typed explicit-lineage binding-mismatch and multiple-terminal ambiguity errors with no mutation. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->
- [x] **RED:** Add explicit-lineage mismatch coverage proving it fails closed and never falls through to a fresh START under that ID. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->
- [x] **RED:** Add duplicate exact-terminal coverage proving sorted ambiguity, no lineage/receipt mutation, and stable replay output. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->
- [x] **TRIANGULATE:** Verify exact replay, concurrent exact START CAS behavior, explicit-lineage behavior, and receipt preservation with focused facade tests and `pnpm test`. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->
- [x] **REFACTOR:** Keep capture-before-scan ordering, deterministic ID sorting, and read-only decisions free of mutation. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->

## 4. Route controller INSPECT and START by the live candidate

**Files:** `extensions/gentle-ai.ts`, `tests/review-controller.test.ts`.

- [x] **GREEN:** Add optional policy-bound INSPECT applicability metadata while retaining unfiltered repository-wide inventory and compatibility-first blocking. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->
- [x] **GREEN:** Route linked-worktree path-only matches to terminal reuse and material candidate differences to fresh START; preserve existing receipt behavior. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->
- [x] **RED:** Add linked-worktree tests for identical binding plus policy, path-only difference, every material candidate difference, and candidate A receipt gate-validatability after candidate B starts. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->
- [x] **RED:** Add bare INSPECT `policy-unresolved`, policy-bound applicable/not-applicable/ambiguous, and deterministic inventory assertions. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->
- [x] **TRIANGULATE:** Cover legacy, graph-v1, mixed, ambiguous, compact-invalid, active, and reset-in-progress authority with no bypass. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->
- [x] **REFACTOR:** Ensure START never trusts prior INSPECT and candidate-aware logic remains limited to compact terminal applicability. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->

## 5. Establish SDD ownership parsing and status accounting

**Files:** `lib/sdd-status.ts`, `tests/sdd-status.test.ts`.

- [x] **RED:** Add parser tests for unmarked legacy rows, canonical implementation/parent markers, checked/unchecked combinations, and legacy completion routing to `parent-lifecycle`. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->
- [x] **GREEN:** Add const-derived `SDD_TASK_OWNER`, line-oriented parsing, implementation `taskProgress`, and additive `deferredParentActions`/`taskArtifactErrors` fields in every status constructor. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->
- [x] **RED:** Add malformed marker tests for unsupported/uppercase/duplicate/non-terminal/unterminated markers, including checked malformed rows. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->
- [x] **GREEN:** Account malformed rows as unresolved implementation work, emit exact diagnostics and blocked reasons, and route to `fix-task-ownership-marker`. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->
- [x] **TRIANGULATE:** Verify rendering, empty/non-authoritative constructors, parent visibility, legacy compatibility, and no prose-based ownership inference. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->
- [x] **REFACTOR:** Keep one parser/progress accumulator and flat status interfaces. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->

## 6. Update SDD task/apply/status/support contracts

**Files:** `assets/agents/sdd-tasks.md`, `assets/agents/sdd-apply.md`, `assets/agents/sdd-status.md`, `assets/support/sdd-status-contract.md`.

- [x] **RED:** Add asset-language assertions covering canonical markers, legacy default, malformed fail-closed behavior, separated progress, and parent-lifecycle routing. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->
- [x] **GREEN:** Require `sdd-tasks` to mark every generated checkbox exactly once, keep parent lifecycle prose separate, and never assign bounded review to implementation work. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->
- [x] **GREEN:** Require `sdd-apply` to select/check/report only implementation rows, preserve parent rows, stop on artifact errors, and return `parent-lifecycle` after implementation completion. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->
- [x] **GREEN:** Document the shared marker grammar, additive status shape, route table, and marker-independent review obligation in status/support contracts. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->
- [x] **TRIANGULATE:** Assert apply prohibition on review/refutation/correction/validation actors and receipt creation/approval; ordinary delivery remains repository policy. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->

## 7. Update full-chain routing and verification contracts

**Files:** `assets/chains/sdd-full.chain.md`, `tests/artifact-language.test.ts`, `tests/sdd-status.test.ts`.

- [x] **RED:** Add chain and artifact-language regressions proving completed implementation yields to the parent boundary and no review actor is added to the chain. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->
- [x] **GREEN:** Amend the full chain so every completed apply yields to parent lifecycle unless authoritative approved receipt evidence already exists; resume independent verification only after approval. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->
- [x] **GREEN:** Keep sync/archive behind verification readiness and keep ordinary delivery outside Pi review authority. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->
- [x] **TRIANGULATE:** Cover no parent markers, checked/unchecked parent markers, missing/approved/invalidated/scope-changed/escalated/ambiguous receipt authority, and archive blockers. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->

## 8. Cross-cutting implementation verification

**Files:** all changed production/test/assets plus `apply-progress.md` and `verify-report.md`.

- [x] **TRIANGULATE:** Run focused runtime tests, focused status/asset tests, `git diff --check`, available type/lint checks, and full `pnpm test`; record exact results. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->
- [x] **REFACTOR:** Remove test-only switches, worktree identity, schema changes, duplicated comparison logic, and unrelated edits; confirm pure code/asset rollback. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->
- [x] **TRIANGULATE:** Record the acceptance matrix, exact implementation checkbox updates, untouched parent lifecycle prose, receipt-preservation evidence, and unresolved warnings in apply/verification artifacts. <!-- sdd-owner: implementation -->

## Parent post-apply review evidence

This section is mandatory parent/orchestrator procedure, not apply work and not part of implementation progress. It intentionally contains no implementation checkbox. After all implementation-owned rows and verification evidence are complete, the parent must yield at this boundary. The parent/orchestrator may start or reuse native bounded review using authority-first review rules: reuse only an authoritatively approved receipt valid for the live candidate; otherwise explicitly run `review/start`; preserve review evidence for scope-changed, invalidated, escalated, ambiguous, invalid, or missing authority. The parent must not infer review approval from task text or checkbox state.

After review approval, the receipt remains review-only evidence. Independent SDD verification may proceed according to its own requirements; sync/archive additionally require verification readiness. Ordinary commit, push, PR, and release always follow repository policy and never depend on Pi review authority. The parent marks any explicit parent review rows only when it actually performs those actions. `sdd-apply` must never perform this section.

## Verification Matrix

| Requirement | Evidence target |
|---|---|
| Complete candidate binding and provenance | Per-dimension facade/controller regressions and authority tuple tests |
| Receipt preservation | Byte/hash and review-evidence checks before/after another candidate START |
| Same-lineage idempotency | Exact replay, explicit mismatch, ambiguity, and CAS tests |
| SDD ownership | Parser/status/apply/asset/chain tests with canonical markers |
| Parent boundary | Status and chain tests proving unconditional post-apply handoff and no apply review actors |
| Compatibility | Legacy, graph-v1, mixed, invalid, active, ambiguous, and reset-in-progress tests |
| Persistence/schema compatibility | Existing receipt/state loading, unchanged bytes/layout, and full `pnpm test` |
